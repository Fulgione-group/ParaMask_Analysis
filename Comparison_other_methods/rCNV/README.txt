The Script run_rCNV.r was used for rCNV, using "kmeans" to filter SNPs in multicopy regions
ParaMask_rCNV_SV_and_rCNV_ParaMask_overlap.R script assess the Overlap between ParaMask and rCNV as well as the Overlap between rCNV and 
SVs called from long-reads
Evaluate_sim_rCNV.R was used to evaluate rCNV performance on simulations
