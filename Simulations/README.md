# Overview

We simulated duplications interdispersed among single-copy regions for different proportions of duplications $p$ from 0% to 50%. For this we first sample seqeunce length of duplication from a exponential distribution with a mean of 1000 bp and single-copy seqeunce lenth from a geometric distribution with $mean = 1-p/(N<sup>duplications</sup> +1 )$
