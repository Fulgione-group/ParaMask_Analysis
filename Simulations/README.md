# Overview

We simulated duplications interdispersed among single-copy regions for different proportions of duplications $p$ from 0% to 50%. For this we first sampled seqeunce lengths of duplication from a exponential distribution with a mean of 1000 bp and single-copy seqeunce lengths from a geometric distribution with $mean = (N<sub>total</sub>-p)/(N<sub>duplications</sub> +1 )$ for a total sequence  sequence length of 1 Mbp.
