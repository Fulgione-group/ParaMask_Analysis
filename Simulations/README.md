# Overview

We simulated duplications interdispersed among single-copy regions for different proportions of duplications $p$ from 0% to 50%. For this we first sampled seqeunce lengths of duplication from a exponential distribution with a mean of 1000 bp and single-copy sequence lengths from a geometric distribution with mean = (L<sub>total</sub>-p)/(N<sub>duplications</sub> + 1) for a total sequence length L<sub>total</sub> of 1 Mbp. Than we ran simulations for each duplicated and single-copy region seperately. We collapsed duplicated regions by converting sites with a derived alleles on exactly one of the copies to heterozygotes. Lastly we simulated coverage for each site and genotype by sampling from a negative binomial with overdispersion parameter \theta<sub>NB<\sub> = 8, and mean 10 or 20 for single-copy and duplications respectively
