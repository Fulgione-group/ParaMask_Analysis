# Overview 
ParaMask scripts for fot Paramask runs on Simulations and Spanish *Arabis alpina* populations. For all ParaMask runs we used only, biallic SNPs with genotype quality >=30 and min depth >=5.
<br>
## Simulations
for simulations we used default settings with maximum 10% missingness per site for all ParaMask steps.
## SpanishArabisAlpina
For the *A. alpina* population genomic data we used default setting for all parameters with maximum missingness of 10% per site in all Paramask steps, except that we set the number of iterations in the distance EM algorithm to 100.
