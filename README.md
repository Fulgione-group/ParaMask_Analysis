Scripts to simulate a mosaic of single-copy and duplicated regions using forward genetic simulator with segmental duplications SeDuS 

## SNP calling
GATK ([DePristo et al., 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.806)) pipeline used to call SNPs for Spanish *A. alpina* populations that we tested ParaMask on.

## Jsfs_and_demographic_inference
Scripts to produce joint Site-Freqeuncy-Spectra (SFS), SFS based demographic inference using [dadi](https://dadi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)([Gutenkunst et al. 2009](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695)).
