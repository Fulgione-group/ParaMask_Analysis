# Overview
This repository encompasses all code that was used to test and analyze [ParaMask](https://github.com/Fulgione-group/ParaMask.git) results. For questions please contact us via [email](btjeng@mpipz.mpg.de).

## Simulations

Scripts to simulate a mosaic of single-copy and duplicated regions using forward genetic simulator with segmental duplications SeDuS ([Hartas√°nchez et al., 2015](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/1/148/1742451)). These scripts were used to conduct simulations on a range of different duplicated sequence proportions, and with random mating and Inbreeding (F<sub>IS</sub>=0.9) 

## SNP calling
GATK ([DePristo et al., 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.806)) pipeline used to call SNPs for Spanish *A. alpina* populations that we tested ParaMask on.

## Jsfs_and_demographic_inference
Scripts to produce joint Site-Freqeuncy-Spectra (SFS), SFS based demographic inference using [dadi](https://dadi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)([Gutenkunst et al. 2009](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695)).
